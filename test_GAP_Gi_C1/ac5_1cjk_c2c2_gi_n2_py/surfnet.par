Notes:-

Note 1. type is one of the following characters:-
    A - Atoms only, each atom will be plotted as a sphere
    a - As for A, but atoms coloured according to B-factor (0-80)
    B - Bonds between atoms
    C - Contours generated according to the density of atoms
    E - Contours generated according to the B-values
    G - Gap map (see below)
    J - Each atom coordinate is joined to the one before and after it
    P - Pairs distribution where each sidechain is shown (by bonds
        joining the atoms) separately
    S - Surface contours at van der Waals radius of each atom (contour
        level of 100.0). If an asterisk, *, follows the S, then the
        radius of each atom will be picked up from the B-value column
        of the PBD file. Otherwise, the default van der Waals radii are
        used.
    % - As C above, but all density values in the output grid are
        adjusted such that the value at each grid-point gives the
        percentage of non-zero grid-points with lower values.

For a Gap map (type G) the first number after it refers to which file is to
be used for generating gaps from. If this is a zero, then gaps are required
between ALL atoms. The second number after the G should be a zero.

For a surface contour (type S), each atom/data-point can have its own
radius defined in the B-value column of the PDB file. This will be used if
there is an asterisk, *, before the S.

Note 2. The contour level can be entered as a percentage by entry of a %
after the contour value.

Note 3. Colours can be entered separately for the foreground and projected
objects. The colours are as follows:

   0=white, 1=yellow, 2=cyan, 3=lime green, 4=green, 5=blue, 6=pink,
   7=orange, 8=red, 9=purple, 10=black, 11=Light blue, 12=Cream

If the colour PostScript option in SURFPLOT below is set to N, the colour
values will be interpreted as grey shades (0=white to 10=black).

If the colour is entered as -999 for the foreground object, the object will
not be displayed. Similarly, for the background projections

For "atom" objects (displayed as spheres), if the colour is set between -1
and -10, a single point, of the corresponding colour, will be plotted
rather than a sphere.

For SOLID surfaces, if in black and white, a negative colour causes all
polygons to be shaded white, giving a sketched, cartoon appearance.

If a 'G' is entered after the background colour, then the background
object will be displayed in grey (ie as shadow) for a colour PostScript
file.

Note 4. Line widths can be set to any real number (a sensible range being
0.0-5.0). The widths of the projected lines will be a fifth of those for
the foreground object.
